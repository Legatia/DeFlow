### **OPENING HOOK (30 seconds)**
*[Show slide: Complex DeFi interface with multiple screens]*

**"Raise your hand if you've ever tried to manage DeFi strategies across multiple chains..."**

**"The current DeFi world looks like this - spreadsheets, multiple exchanges, manual monitoring. You miss opportunities because you're sleeping."**
