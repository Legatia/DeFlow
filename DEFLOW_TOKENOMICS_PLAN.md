# DeFlow Tokenomics Plan: $FLOW Token
*A Comprehensive Economic Model for DeFi Automation Platform*

---

## Executive Summary

The $FLOW token creates a sustainable economic ecosystem where every DeFi operation generates value for users, platform growth, and long-term sustainability. Our tokenomics model incentivizes platform usage, rewards early adopters, and creates multiple utility mechanisms beyond simple governance.

**Key Innovation:** Activity-based rewards system where DeFi operations, social media automation, and platform engagement all generate $FLOW tokens, creating the first "Earn-by-DeFi" ecosystem.

## 7. Economic Projections & Modeling

### Phase 1 Targets (Pre-Launch - Building to 1 BTC Pool)
- **Active Users**: 1,000+ early adopters earning pre-launch tokens
- **Pool Asset Target**: 1 BTC equivalent (~$60,000 TVL minimum)
- **$FLOW Pre-Distributed**: 10-20M tokens via airdrops (future value IOUs)
- **Community Engagement**: High retention through future value anticipation

### Phase 2 Launch Targets (Post-1 BTC Milestone)
- **Token Price Discovery**: Based on ckBTC yield/pool assets ratio (market-determined)
- **Initial Circulating Supply**: Pre-distributed tokens become tradeable
- **Real Utility Launch**: Immediate use for fee discounts and staking
- **Growth Target**: 2,500+ active users within 6 months of launch

### Revenue Impact Analysis
- **Subscription Revenue**: +40% (token discounts drive upgrades)
- **Transaction Volume**: +150% (rewards incentivize activity)
