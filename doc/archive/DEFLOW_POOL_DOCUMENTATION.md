---

## Core Components

### 1. Pool State (`PoolState`)

The central state structure that maintains all pool information:

```rust
pub struct PoolState {
    // Pool operational state
    pub phase: PoolPhase,
    
    // Cross-chain liquidity reserves
    pub reserves: HashMap<ChainId, HashMap<Asset, LiquidityReserve>>,
    
    // Integrated dev team business model
    pub dev_team_business: DevTeamBusinessModel,
    
    // Pool metrics
    pub total_liquidity_usd: f64,
    pub monthly_volume: f64,
    pub fee_collection_rate: f64,
    
    // Bootstrap targets
    pub bootstrap_targets: HashMap<Asset, u64>,
}
```

### 2. Pool Phases

The pool operates in three distinct phases:

#### Bootstrapping Phase
- **Purpose**: Accumulate initial liquidity from transaction fees
- **Duration**: Until bootstrap targets are met
- **Target Liquidity**:
  - USDC: $200,000
  - USDT: $100,000  
  - ETH: 60 ETH
  - BTC: 3 BTC
  - SOL: 2,000 SOL

#### Active Phase
- **Purpose**: Full operational mode with arbitrage and cross-chain trading
- **Features**: All pool functions available
- **Monitoring**: Continuous reserve ratio and utilization tracking

#### Emergency Phase
- **Purpose**: Pause operations during critical issues
- **Access**: Manager-level access required to activate
- **Recovery**: Owner approval required to resume operations

### 3. Supported Assets & Chains

#### Assets
```rust
pub enum Asset {
    BTC,    // Bitcoin
    ETH,    // Ethereum
    USDC,   // USD Coin
    USDT,   // Tether USD
    DAI,    // Dai Stablecoin
    SOL,    // Solana
    MATIC,  // Polygon
    AVAX,   // Avalanche
}
```

#### Chains
```rust
pub enum ChainId {
    Bitcoin,
    Ethereum,
    Arbitrum,
    Optimism,
    Polygon,
    Base,
    Solana,
    Avalanche,
}
```

---

## Business Model Integration

### Team Hierarchy

The pool includes a sophisticated team management system with role-based access:

```rust
pub enum TeamRole {
    Owner,              // Full system control
    SeniorManager,      // Financial oversight, team management
    OperationsManager,  // Day-to-day operations
    TechManager,        // Technical operations
    Developer,          // Basic access, profit sharing
}
```

### Revenue Streams

The business model tracks multiple revenue sources:

1. **Transaction Fees**: 30% of all platform fees go to dev team profit
2. **Subscription Revenue**: Monthly/yearly subscription payments
3. **Enterprise Revenue**: Custom enterprise contracts

### Profit Distribution

**Monthly Distribution Logic**:
- **Minimum Threshold**: $5,000 profit required for distribution
- **Distribution Split**: 
  - 80% distributed to team members (equal shares)
  - 20% reserved for business growth
- **Team Member Benefits**: All team members receive equal profit shares regardless of role

**Distribution Formula**:
```rust
let net_profit = total_revenue - operating_costs;
if net_profit >= minimum_distribution_threshold {
    let distributable = net_profit * 0.8;
    let reserve = net_profit * 0.2;
    let per_member = distributable / total_team_members;
}
```

### Premium Access

**Dev Team Benefits**:
- **Automatic Premium+**: All team members get highest tier access
- **Reduced Fees**: 0.1% vs 0.85% for regular users
- **Unlimited Volume**: No transaction limits
- **Priority Support**: Enhanced customer service

---

## Liquidity Management

### Reserve Structure

Each chain maintains separate reserves for each supported asset:

```rust
pub struct LiquidityReserve {
    pub total_amount: u64,           // Total liquidity in this asset
    pub fee_contributed_amount: u64, // Amount from fee collection
    pub last_updated: u64,           // Timestamp of last update
    pub daily_growth_rate: f64,      // Growth rate tracking
    pub utilization_rate: f64,       // How much is being used
}
```

### Fee Collection Process

1. **Fee Split**: When users pay transaction fees:
   - 70% goes to pool liquidity reserves
   - 30% goes to dev team profit

2. **Automatic Processing**:
   ```rust
   let pool_portion = (amount as f64 * 0.7) as u64;
   let profit_portion = amount as f64 * 0.3;
   ```

3. **Bootstrap Tracking**: System automatically checks if bootstrap targets are met after each deposit

### Liquidity Operations

#### Adding Liquidity
- **Access Level**: Manager and above
- **Process**: Direct addition to reserves with tracking
- **Monitoring**: Automatic bootstrap progress calculation

#### Withdrawing for Execution
- **Access Level**: Manager and above
- **Purpose**: Execute arbitrage opportunities or cross-chain trades
- **Tracking**: Full audit trail maintained

#### Reserve Monitoring
- **Real-time Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of reserve levels
- **Utilization Rates**: Track how much liquidity is actively used
- **Growth Analytics**: Daily/monthly growth rate calculations

---

## Cross-Chain Operations

### Arbitrage Detection

The pool continuously monitors for profitable arbitrage opportunities across supported chains:

```rust
pub struct ArbitrageOpportunity {
    pub asset_pair: (String, String),
    pub buy_chain: ChainId,
    pub sell_chain: ChainId,
    pub price_difference: f64,
    pub expected_profit: f64,
    pub required_capital: f64,
    pub confidence_score: f64,
}
```

### Cross-Chain Trading

**Execution Process**:
1. **Opportunity Detection**: Scan all chain pairs for price differences
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate slippage, gas costs, and timing risks
3. **Capital Allocation**: Determine optimal trade size based on available reserves
4. **Execution**: Coordinate simultaneous trades across chains
5. **Settlement**: Update reserves and track profits

**Access Control**: Only managers and above can execute cross-chain trades

### Supported Trading Pairs

The system supports arbitrage across all asset-chain combinations:
- BTC: Bitcoin ↔ Ethereum (Wrapped BTC)
- ETH: Ethereum ↔ Arbitrum ↔ Optimism ↔ Polygon ↔ Base
- Stablecoins: USDC/USDT across all EVM chains
- SOL: Solana native operations

    pub requires_owner_approval: bool,
    pub timestamp: u64,
    pub approved: bool,
    pub request_id: u64,
}
```

**Internet Identity Integration**:
- All access tied to ICP Principal IDs
- Seamless integration with ICP ecosystem
- Enhanced security through cryptographic identity

### Team Management Operations

#### Adding Team Members
1. **Manager Request**: Any manager can request to add developers
2. **Owner Approval**: Owner approval required for management roles
3. **Automatic Benefits**: New members automatically get premium access
4. **Earnings Setup**: Profit sharing immediately activated

#### Role Changes
1. **Request System**: Managers can request role changes
2. **Approval Workflow**: Owner approval for promotions

## Fee Collection & Revenue

### Fee Structure

**User Tiers**:
- **Free Tier**: 0.85% transaction fees
- **Premium Tier**: Custom rates (set via subscription)
- **Dev Team**: 0.1% transaction fees (Premium+)

### Revenue Tracking

**Real-time Monitoring**:
```rust
pub struct DevTeamBusinessModel {
    // Monthly revenue tracking
    pub monthly_subscription_revenue: f64,
    pub monthly_transaction_fees: f64,
    pub monthly_enterprise_revenue: f64,
    pub monthly_operating_costs: f64,
    
    // Team earnings distribution
    pub team_member_earnings: HashMap<Principal, f64>,
    pub total_distributed_profits: f64,
    
    // Business reserves
    pub emergency_fund: f64,
    pub reinvestment_fund: f64,
}
```

### Distribution Process

**Monthly Cycle**:
1. **Revenue Calculation**: Sum all revenue streams
2. **Cost Deduction**: Subtract operating costs ($15K default)
3. **Threshold Check**: Ensure minimum $5K profit
4. **Distribution**: 80% to team, 20% to reserves
5. **Reset Counters**: Prepare for next month

**Withdrawal Process**:
- Team members can withdraw earnings anytime
- Withdrawal resets personal earnings to zero
- In production, triggers ICP token transfer
