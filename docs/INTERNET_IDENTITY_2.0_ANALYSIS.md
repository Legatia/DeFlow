authMethod: 'nfid' | 'internet-identity' | null
```

### **NFID Usage Patterns**
```typescript
// NFID primarily used for Google authentication
loginWithNFID: () => Promise<boolean>

// Welcome message emphasizes Google via NFID
'Logged in with Google via NFID. You now have access to premium features.'
