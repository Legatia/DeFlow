## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Chain Fusion Complexity**: Start with simple operations, iterate
- **DeFi Protocol Changes**: Use stable API versions, implement fallbacks
- **Performance Issues**: Implement caching, optimize critical paths
- **Integration Failures**: Build comprehensive error handling

### Timeline Risks
- **Feature Creep**: Stick to MVP scope, defer nice-to-haves
- **Integration Delays**: Parallel development, early testing
- **Bug Discovery**: Daily testing, continuous integration
- **Deployment Issues**: Practice deployments, have rollback plans

### Success Metrics
- **Week 1**: Core workflow execution working locally
- **Week 2**: Multi-chain transactions executing successfully
- **Week 3**: Full DeFi strategies running end-to-end
- **Final**: Production deployment with working demo workflows

This aggressive timeline is achievable with focused execution, parallel development streams, and minimal scope creep. The key is building the core functionality first, then layering on advanced features systematically.
